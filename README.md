# Menu bar
Code developed in C# Windows Form application mode. The program aims to bring up the menu bar with submenus, for example the "file" button which has a submenu and the "sair" button which closes the application. By clicking on the buttons of the submenu file, you have access to the forms FrmWanela, FrmWanela02 and FrmWanela 03, clicking on the button "sair" triggers a confirmation message for the exit of the program.

The main file is <b><i>MainForm.cs</i></b>, which gives you access to the other files through the menu bar.

Here is a gif of how the application works:
